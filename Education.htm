    <h1> Elementary School </h1>
        <p> I went to Major Edwards Elementary School. It is a small school located in West Boylston, Massachusetts. There were only about 70 kids in my grade, and of course that number beceame smaller as we progressed through the grades. </p>

    <h2> Middle School </h2>
        <p> After school in West Boylston, I school choiced to Grafton Middle School for the 7th and 8th grade. I made new friends, became somewhat of a better student, and got to play ice hockey for the middle school team. </p>

    <h3> High School </h3>
    	<p> After middle school at Grafton, I chose to stay there for high school. There I was the class of 2019 at Grafton High School. It was eventful attending school there. Pep rallies were always fun. School dances provided the average awkwardness each teenager should experience in a lifetime. But there were some upsides. I got to play for both the JV and the Varsity hockey team. I watched some of my closest friends win a state championship. I made some friends for life at that school. </p>
