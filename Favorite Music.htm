        <H1> Classic Rock </H1>
        	<p> I enjoy almost all types of music, but one of my most facorite genres of music has to be classic rock. Throughout the 1960's, 70's, and 80's artists really took their thoughts and put them to music. Songs in this genre can be about war, love, civil disobedience, etc. This generation of music really shows the raw emotions that people can put out and also showcases the abilities of the musicians singing, songwriting, and musical talents. </p>

    	<H1> Rap/Hip-Hop </H1>
    		<p> Rap and hip-hop show a different view of music. This can be inspired by anything from street life, to friends rapping about parties and childhood. It takes an acquired taste to appreciate some of the artistic abilities of a rapper. Not everyone will enjoy the tech based beats, or in most cases the violent and vulgar language. But to those that do, the creaters of this extreme music genre seem god like. </p>

		<h1> Country </h1>
			<p> Most poeple love to hate on this music genre, but I enjoy listening to country music. Being from the north, there are not many country songs that relate to what goes on up here, but it is still nice to think of the red skies over farmland. The country music is often a lot slower and has a more pronounced singer. Often times the singer is talking about fishing, drinking with friends, or a heartbreak over some girl. Other times they are just singing about their experiences growing up. Country music is probably one of the best ways to understand how background information about an artist really shows how they made it to the top. </p>

		<h1> Pop/New Releases </h1>
			<p> Now in the 2010's, soon to be 2020's we are being introduced to new genres of music that we call pop music. This is coming from artists such as Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, and John Mayer. Another emergence in this genre is the reintroduction of boy bands such as One Direction and the Jonas Brothers. Often times these newer artists are liked widely by young girls. Pop music generally is being sung about heartbreaks/relationships, friendships, and growing up. </p>

		<h1> Relevance To Me </h1>
			<p> All the types of music listed were areas where I enjoyed listening to their finished products. Music is a way for people to express themselves. Often times people use music to find the words or the voice that they cannot express themselves. Music is so much more than just a few instruments and a singer with a decent voice. It takes experiences, stories, and the ability to connect with the aaudience to become successful in the music industry. If you can connect with people, then they will listen to your music. </p>
			<p> Music has grown to become a large portion of my life. I love talking about musicians and different albums. I enjoy watching the music videps and how the music is portrayed by the artist. But one of my favorite thing to do is to learn the song myself. I play the guitar and often times I am watching YouTube videos teaching myself how to play the song that I love to listen to on the guitar. Music provides a sense of accomplishment as when you find a new ability you just want to continue doing what makes you happy. Some people have sports, others have music, and some people have other things. No matter what, do what makes you happy because life is too short to force yourself to do things you don't enjoy. </p>
