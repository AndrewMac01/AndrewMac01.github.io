<h1> These are some of my hobbies </h1>
<h2> Ice Hockey </h2>
<p> I enjoy playing ice hockey. I'm not playing right now but I have played this sport for about 15 years. My favorite team is the Boston Bruins and I enjoy watching the University of Maine Blackbears play in HockeyEast.</p>

<h3> Trap and Skeet Shooting </h3>
<p> I am a National Championship, All-State Team Captain for Massachusetts in shotgun sports. I am ranked 96 in the nation for all SCTP (Scholastic Clay Target Program) competitors. I have captained an All-State team for Team Massachusetts for two years. Also, I am a team "captain" for my local youth shooting team. I have been competing in this sport since the 8th grade and have continued my shooting career into my university life at the University of Maine shooting for the Maine Trap and Skeet Club.</p>

<h4> Video Games </h4>
<p> I have an Xbox one and I play video games more for leisure rather than for a competitive sport. I do like the competitive spirit of the games such as Rocket League and Call of Duty, but I am playing the games more for the fun and its an easier way to pass time. </p>
